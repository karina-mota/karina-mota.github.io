      <h1> Javascript and The DOM</h1>
        An analogy to describe the differences between HTML and CSS<br>
        HTML is like a house under construction, with its bear minimum and liveable standards.<br>
        CSS is that same house designed and decorated. With its walls painted, following a design<br>
        pattern and its rooms furnished.<br>
        Explain control flow and loops using an example process from everyday life,<br>
        for example 'waking up' or 'brushing your teeth'. (But not those ones).<br>
        Control flow<br>
        You are making a soup following a recipe. You will need to add the required ingredients<br>
        and follow the instructions in the same sequence as described in the recipe book.<br>
        <br>
        Loop<br>
        Now you will need to salt the soup to your taste. Your process is to add salt, stir and taste.<br>
        Then if the condition wasnâ€™t met (soup not salted to your taste), you will repeat the process - add salt, stir and taste.<br>
        You will continue to do this until the condition is met.<br>
        <br>
        Describe what the DOM is and an example of how you might interact with it.<br>
        The DOM is the full parse representation of the HTML.<br>
        HTML uses tags that are made up of special text inside angle brackets that gives browser instructions.<br> 
        When the browser identifies these tags, a token is emitted by the Tokenizer. These tokens are consumed and<br>
        converted into Node objects. The start and end tokens shows the relationship between the nodes.<br>
        It shows if a specific node is the child or parent of another node.<br>
        The Document Object Model - or simply The Dom - is the tree representation document that captures all the contents<br>
        and properties of these consumed nodes.<br>
        <br>
        Explain the difference between accessing data from arrays and objects.<br>
        
        Explain what functions are and why they are useful.<br>
