        <h1> Javascript and The DOM</h1>
        <u>An analogy to describe the differences between HTML and CSS</u><br>
        <br>
        HTML is like a house under construction, with its bear minimum and liveable standards.<br>
        CSS is that same house designed and decorated. With its walls painted, following a design<br>
        pattern and its rooms furnished.<br>
        <br>
        <u>Explain control flow and loops using an example process from everyday life</u><br>
        <br>
        Control flow<br>
        You are making a soup following a recipe. You will need to add the required ingredients<br>
        and follow the instructions in the same sequence as described in the recipe book.<br>
        <br>
        Loop<br>
        Now you will need to salt the soup to your taste. Your process is to add salt, stir and taste.<br>
        Then if the condition wasn’t met (soup not salted to your taste), you will repeat the process - add salt, stir and taste.<br>
        You will continue to do this until the condition is met.<br>
        <br>
        <u>Describe what the DOM is and an example of how you might interact with it.</u><br>
        <br>
        The DOM is the full parse representation of the HTML.<br>
        HTML uses tags that are made up of special text inside angle brackets that gives browser instructions.<br> 
        When the browser identifies these tags, a token is emitted by the Tokenizer. These tokens are consumed and<br>
        converted into Node objects. The start and end tokens shows the relationship between the nodes.<br>
        It shows if a specific node is the child or parent of another node.<br>
        The Document Object Model - or simply The Dom - is the tree representation document that captures all the contents<br>
        and properties of these consumed nodes.<br>
        <br>
        Interacting with the DOM<br>
        A really exciting way to interact with the DOM is altering the contents of a webpage.<br>
        See how I can magically turn myself into an ultramarathon atlete below<br>

        <u>Explain the difference between accessing data from arrays and objects.</u><br>
        <br>
        Array<br>
        square brackets notation [ ]<br>
        Arrays work by index.<br>
        Arrays are used to store multiple items of the same kind.<br>
        Array is used when order is the most important factor for organising the information.<br>
        When you retrieve information from the array, you use the index of each element.<br>
        Arrays are 0-indexed, which means they start counting at 0 rather than 1.<br>
        <br>
        The below is an example of using objects to organise New Zealand’s Great Walks<br>
        <br>
        <div class="example-image">
            <img src="../Photos/snip-array.png" alt="Array example" style="width:380px;height:180px;"><br>
        </div>
        <br>
        Object<br>
        Curly brackets notation { }<br> 
        For collections of data<br>
        Objects are best when you want to organise based on data labels, when dealing with multiple related variables.<br>
        Object you use to represent on whole thing, with different categories for that main thing. An example is a person.<br>
        A person has a first name, a last name, age, a phone number, an address and so on.<br>
        <br>
        Object - Incorrect:<br>
        <div class="example-image">
            <img src="../Photos/snip_object_example1.png" alt="Object - incorrect" style="width:300px;height:160px;"><br>
        </div>
        <br>
        Object - Correct:<br>
        <div class="example-image">
            <img src="../Photos/snip_object_example2.png" alt="Object - Correct" style="width:300px;height:160px;"><br>
        </div>
        <br>
        <u>Explain what functions are and why they are useful.</u><br>
        <br>
        Function is a set of statements that performs a task or calculates a value. <br>
