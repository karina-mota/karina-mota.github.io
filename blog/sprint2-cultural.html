            <h3>
                If not well balanced, my strength and limitations have both positive and negative aspects. 
<u>Strength:</u>
No matter the curve ball life has thrown, I’ve always kept my pace and moved forward.  This has made me resilient and adaptive. I’m not afraid to take a new path in search of a better outcome.
I don’t get put off when I have a problem. I usually like to dig deep into a problem, understand what is causing it and find a solution. I like to identify the root cause to a problem to prevent the same error in the future. 
<u>Limitation:</u>
My strength to dig deep into a problem can also be my limitation. As I am too meticulous, I can dig myself into a rabbit hole and then have to rush to meet a deadline. 
My decision making skills are far from being the best. I tend to weight both sides of a decision which makes me extremely indecisive and fear of missing out of the unchosen path.

            <h3>
                My biggest challenge is to organise my hours during weekdays to study. I work full time and I arrive home late from work and it can be quite overwhelming to jump to a computer after spending more than 8 hours in front of a computer at work. 
My weeknight routine includes household chores, organize/get ready for the night and following day, meal prepping and studying. 
In order to be able to have study time after work, I’ve established to wake up between 5-5:30am on most weekdays to make sure I get enough time to do my morning stretch exercises and meditation before work.

                I expect support, respect and patience from the facilitation team and fellow students. When having issues, I intend to reach out to our programme colleagues, facilitators via right channels. I also intend to search for answers online, in e.g. Google.
