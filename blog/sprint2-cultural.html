            <p>
                My long term goal is to become a good developer and pursue<br>
                a new career path.

            </p>
            <p>
                I would like to improve my time management skills, which I believe is <br>
                essential for my future in this new career.

                <strong><u>Strength and Limitations</u></strong>
            </p>
            <p>
                If not well balanced, my strength and limitations have both positive and <br>
                negative aspects. 
            <p><u>Strength:</u></p>
            <p>
                <ol>
                <l>No matter the curve ball life has thrown, I’ve always kept my pace and moved <br>
                forward.  This has made me resilient and adaptive. I’m not afraid to take a new path <br>
                in search of a better outcome.</l>
                <l>I don’t get put off when I have a problem. I usually like to dig deep into a problem, <br>
                understand what is causing it and find a solution. I like to identify the root cause to a <br>
                problem to prevent the same error in the future. </l>
                </ol>
                <p>
                <u>Limitation:</u></p>
                <ol>
                <l>My strength to dig deep into a problem can also be my limitation. <br>
                As I am too meticulous, I can dig myself into a rabbit hole and then have to rush to meet a deadline.<br></l> 
                <l>My decision making skills are far from being the best.<br>
                I tend to weight both sides of a decision which makes me extremely <br>
                indecisive and fear of missing out of the unchosen path. </l><br>
                <l>Opening myself to others is a very hard process for me. </l>
                </ol>

                <u>Planning and commitment & Managing Workload</u>
            </p>
            <p>
                My biggest challenge is to organise my hours during weekdays to study. I work full time and I arrive <br>
                home late from work and it can be quite overwhelming to jump to a computer after spending more than 8 hours<br>
                in front of a computer at work. 
                My weeknight routine includes household chores, organize/get ready for the night and following day, <br>
                meal prepping and studying. 
                In order to be able to have study time after work, I’ve established to wake up between 5-5:30am on <br>m
                ost weekdays to make sure I get enough time to do my morning stretch exercises and meditation before work.

                <u>Expectations</u>
            </p>
            <p>
                I expect support, respect and patience from the facilitation team and fellow students. When having issues, <br>
                I intend to reach out to our programme colleagues, facilitators via right channels. I also intend to search for <br>
                answers online, in e.g. Google.
