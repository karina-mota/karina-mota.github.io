    <div class=question>
      <p>Using the evidence gathered, describe your core personal values.<br>
      Explain a situation where you have had an ethical decision to make.  Discuss how you weighed up the values<br>
      involved in that decision, the decision you made and the consequences of the action you took.</p>
      </div>
    <div class=answer>
      <p>In a former job I made a mistake that I was lucky to discover in time to fix and ended up<br>
      not having any effect on the client. However, I decided to share my near miss with my manager, which<br>
      made the company review and change their process which brought more security to their employees and clients.</p>
    </div>

    <div class=question>
      <p>Describe how your culture has influenced your values and identity.</p>
    </div>
    <div class=answer>
      <p>I grew up in a not so wealthy family during an economical crisis in Brazil. <br>
        This led my parents to work very hard to be able to provide the basic needs of the family.<br> 
        My environment was based on hard work and creativity to make ends meet. </p>
        <p>My parents decision to immigrate to another country to find work has been an shift in our lives.<br> 
        We learned to adapt to many circumstances and to work even harder.<br>
        Although financial hardship was something present in our lives, my parents have always<br>
        managed to help others either by providing accommodation, help with work, food or income.<br>
        Today I have more empathy towards others and am always willing to help those in need.<br>
        </p>

    <div class=question> 
      <p>Using the evidence gathered, describe your strengths and limitations.<br>
        Evaluate your strengths and limitations in terms of your learning and career development.</p>
    </div>

    <div class=answer>
      <p> I'm a hard worker and very adaptable to different work environments. I'm open to new ideas and try<br>
        have a growth mindset on a daily basis.<br>
        As per my limitation to open myself to others can be challenging to my colleagues as I will have<br>
        difficulty expressing my true feelings.</p> 
    </div>
    <div class=question>
      <p>Identify which of your strengths might help you in your learning journey<br>
        and how they might intersect with learning obstacles.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class=answer>
      <p>I like to dig into the root of a problem to find a solution, which I believe will benefit
        my learning strategies.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class=question>
      <p>Share an example from your experience of where you were trying to work productively with others, <br>
        but there was resistance or tension. Discuss the strategies you used at that time, how effective<br>
        they were, and your reflections on what other strategies you would try now, and why.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class=answer>
      <p>A colleague and I were trying to implement a new process in our workplace. The manager had assigned me<br>
         to run the new process and gave me the instructions. My colleague wasn't accepting the instructions given<br>
        and wanted to do it another way. After having little progress with the project, our manager had a meeting<br>
        with both of us and gave my colleague the same instructions I had been giving throughout the project.<br>
        After the meeting my colleague had no resistance and followed with the instructions correctly.<br>
      </p>
      <p>
        My colleauge's attitude made me feel insignificant at the time. However, today I realise I could've not been<br>
        clear with the instructions and should've asked my colleague for feedback.</p>
