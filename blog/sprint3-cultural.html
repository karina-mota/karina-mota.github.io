      <p><strong><h2>What is Emotional Intelligence?</p></strong></h2>
      EQ is defined as the individual ability to identify, evaluate, control and express emotions.<br>
      We don’t have much control over the emotions we experience at a given moment but we can control<br>
      our reaction to those emotions by focusing on our thoughts.<br>
      <br>
      <u><strong>Five components of EQ:</u></strong><br>
      <strong>Self-awareness -</strong> the ability to recognize and understand one’s mood, motivations<br>
      and abilities. Also understand the effect they have on others.<br>
      <br>
      <strong>Self-regulation - </strong>the ability to control one’s impulses, the ability to think before <br>
      you speak/react.<br> 
      <br>
      <strong>Motivation -</strong> is having the interest in learning and self-improvement. <br>
      It is the strength to keep going when there are obstacles. Is setting a goal and following through with them.<br>
      <br>
      <strong>Empathy - </strong>it is the ability to understand other people’s emotion and reaction.<br>
      Empathy can only be achieved if self-awareness is achieved. One must be able to understand themselves<br>
      before they can understand others. <br>
      <br>
      <strong>Social Skills -</strong> is the ability to maintain friendship and relationships and finding common <br>
      ground with them.

      <h2>Why is it important?</h2><br>
      People with high EQ usually makes great leaders and team players because of their ability to<br>
      understand, empathize and connect with people around them. While people with high IQ just means<br>
      that a person can have ability to technical skills but doesn’t mean that they will be able to work<br>
      well as a team player or be a good team leader. <br>
